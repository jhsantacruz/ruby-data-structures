====================

Notes: Data structure review in Ruby. 


**Overview about data structures and algorthms.
Linked lists, binary trees, tries, stacks, queues, dynamic arrays, hash tables/maps
Breadth first search, depth first search, binary search, merge sort, quick sort, tree insert/find/etc
Recursion
Big-O time on all of the above
How to identify choices that will result in big performance gains/losses (i.e. don't worry about minor gains/losses), especially if that choice would mean the difference between a feasible solution and an infeasible solution
OOP design principles

- Stacks & Queues
------
1. Allow only a single item to be added or removed at a time
2. Stacks allow access to the last item inserted (LIFO)
3. Queues allow access to the first item inserted (FIFO)
